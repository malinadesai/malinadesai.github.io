        Hi, so <b> excited </b> to meet you!
        <p>
            This is my very first website. I've never written in html, can you believe it? Here's a cool quote from 
            Simon in Fionna and Cake:
        </p>
        <p>
            I stood by and allowed you to sacrifice yourself for me. Even though part of me should've known better. 
            Like that day at the bus stop... I could've made the effort to support you the way you always supported me. 
            Maybe I never would've found the crown. Who knows what life would've been like?
        </p>

        Well, that was a nice pause. Let's go over tags: <br>
        <b> bold </b><br>
        <i> italics </i><br>
        <u>  underline </u><br>
        <em> emphasis </em><br>
        <strong> strong </strong><br>

		Let's play around with some links. Here's my rock playlist:
