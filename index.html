        Hi, so <b> excited </b> to meet you!
        <p>
            This is my very first website. I've never written in html, can you believe it? Here's a cool quote from 
            Simon in Fionna and Cake:
        </p>
        <p>
            I stood by and allowed you to sacrifice yourself for me. Even though part of me should've known better. 
            Like that day at the bus stop... I could've made the effort to support you the way you always supported me. 
            Maybe I never would've found the crown. Who knows what life would've been like?
